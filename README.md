# SVG Art Rails App

This is closely modelled (thus far) on
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

## This will be linked to [*ianscottwilson.com*](http://ianscottwilson.com) and [*littlefermat.com*](http://littlefermat.com)

It will enable users to upload their own svg productions - or links to them. Initially to be hosted on Heroku.
